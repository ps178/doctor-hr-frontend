This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Brief Description
This project uses React JS to create a front-end where doctors can access their patients' heart rate data. 
Patient's email adress is used as the primary key to find the pateint. 
Once the user enters the patient's email and clicks on "Get Data" button, the website will return all of the heart rate data for the patient along with the exact time stamp of each heart rate data entry.

For the project to build, **these files must exist with exact filenames**:

* `public/index.html` is the page template;
* `src/index.js` is the JavaScript entry point.


Subdirectories are created inside `src`. 
You need to **put any JS and CSS files inside `src`**, otherwise Webpack wonâ€™t see them.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

# `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

# `npm install`

To install packages that will be used by the subdirectories in `src`. 
* For instance, axios and materials-iu @ Next need to be installed for this project to run. 

### Set-up Instructions

Once project is downloaded, install [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) and [Material-ui @ Next](https://material-ui-next.com)

After installing axios and materials-ui, `npm run start` on terminal to run the project. The app will automatically open in the browser.
